# INTRODUCTION

Self-motivated individual with a strong technical background, specialising in software automation, integration and quality assurance.

By working closely with senior representatives from across the business, I facilitate frequent, high-quality deliveries that meet the needs of our customers.

I specialise in what is often recognised as a "DevOps" role, by facilitating collaboration between development and operations teams whilst also supporting other departments to provide the highest quality deliverables.

I am the recognised lead on our development and testing infrastructure, consisting of nearly a hundred virtual machines, supporting three technologically distinct product offerings within a highly automated environment.

A certified scrum master, I have previously worked with five concurrent scrum teams across strategic and tactical projects, providing support and direction on developmental practices and provision of technologies to enable smoother delivery.
