We had a large blank wall in the PayPoint office which I wanted to do something interesting with. One idea was to use sheets of phosphoresent paper to coat a large area of this space, then to use a computer controlled laser pointer to "draw" pictures which would fade over time. This would allow for the fact that this wall is high up (10 feet from the bottom) and would make for a display that could be changing over time.

The use of phosphoresent paper rather than simply leaving laser trails was considered as it would allow for longer or more detailed drawing as it would not be reliant on persistence of vision effects, and I believe it would be less distracting as the laster point would not be so harsh as it moves.
