Using some EL Wire Tape create a set of 7 segment display components and use them to create a large scale digital wall mounted clock.

Similar to the GPS clock described below, but by using el wire theres far less hassle with heat and light disipation and should result in a much thinner display.

Possible complications with power as EL Wire requires a more complex high voltage AC based supply, but this should be resolvable.


## EL Nixie Tube Variation

Using EL wire create a Nixie Tube which doesn't need *quite* as much complicated setup as it'd be a few EL wires bent into the 
shapes of a Nixie clock pattern, with each one illuminated as required.
