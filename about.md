Hi!

I'm Toby, and this is what I look like

![Tobys Face](/images/avatar.jpg)

I'm really glad you've found my site, I'm not the best writer in the world, and most of the time I wish I could just dictate my thoughts and let someone else do the writing, so I hope you'll forgive any typos, grammar or extraordinary abuse of the humble comma.

# Who I am

I'm a bit of a dabbler, a jack of all trades and master of *some*. I love finding out new things, learning little bits of this and that and discovering new ways of putting unexpected things together. 

I live in the beautiful city of Bath (UK) with my fiancée in a house filled with exciting half finished (projects)[/projects/], books on every subject and and a rather messy garden.

# What I do "professionally"

I'm a Software Engineer working for (PayPoint Mobile and Online)[https://www.paypoint.com/en-gb/mobile-online], where I work with our development and operations team on finding better and better ways of making our products easier to work with, better for customers to use and faster to develop.
