I have a number of different projects that I dabble with from time to time. Quite often these end up on GitHub

* [TheInternet](/TheInternet/)

See my github page for more


# Project Ideas

- [*] [The Internet](/TheInternet/)
- [ ] Tea Counter
    - Using the load cell from a set of digital scales, measure the weight of a kettle and guesstimate how many brews are consumed over time
- [ ] Ball monitor
    - This was envisioned as an "[Extreme feedback device](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=extreme+feedback+device)" for Jenkins, email, weather etc
	- First attempts - [Controlling a single ORB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ruOxyTRj90)
	- [3 active orbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlQ0-M2k6KE)
	- The project didn't get much further as I ran out of time/ability/enthusiasm
- [ ] Sandwich Safe
    - Add some pointless blinky LEDs, NFC displays and other gubbins to my sandwich box (which looks like a flight case)	
	
## Clock Based Things
	
I have an unusual enthusiasm for time keeping devices and frequently find my project ideas moving towards clocks and their ilk

- [ ] Wheres Toby?
    - Basically real world implementation of the Family clock from Harry Potter
	- Originally planned to use Google Latitude but thats gone away so may need something else
	- Possibly use iBeacons and get mobile phones to "ping home" when they're in certain places (eg work, car, home, etc)
- [ ] Shelf Clock
    - A set of 12 illuminated battery powered cubes that communicate wirelessly to indicate the current time
	- Making 12 wireless things is a pain
	- Current plan to use MSP430s combined with some nrf2401 transceivers
