Senior Software Build and Release Engineer with a strong technical background specialising in automation, integration and quality.

Emphasis on definition and implementation of new development processes and establishing a proactive methodology to ensure high quality output by communicating with product stakeholders within scrums, or working closely with senior representatives from around the business.

I specialise in what is often recognised as a "DevOps" role by facilitating collaboration between development and operations teams, but also support other teams to provide the best quality deliverables from the company to our customers. I am recognised as the lead on our development and testing infrastructure, consisting of over 50 virtual servers supporting 3 distinct product offerings within a highly automated environment.

A certified scrum master, I have worked with 5 concurrent scrum teams across 3 strategic and tactical projects providing support and direction to the team on development practices and provision of technologies to enable smoother delivery.

# EXPERIENCE

## Senior Build and Release Engineer - PayPoint Mobile and Online - 01/2014 - Present

Continuous improvements to the developement build/release processes (through better automation and documentation when appropriate) and the management of development environments for the team. Along with other senior roles within the development team, I encourage and follow good software development practices.

I manage and direct the desktop and datacenter development environments, allowing our development team to provision new desktop based environments through tools such as Vagrant and Puppet so new project work has minimal startup friction.

## Senior Test Engineer - PayPoint.Net 09/2009 - 12/2013

Performed roudns of non-functional performance validation of new datacenters as well as taking formal ownership of testing methods within PayPoint.net. Continued to provide support and direction for development team and wider business in all aspects of quality improvement. 

Implemented new tools and practices including emulation tools, mavenised build and release processes, baselined our legacy systems to provide robust release mechanism and automated delivery cycles.

## Systems Developer - PayPoint.Net 03/2007 - 09/2009

Quickly got up to speed with commercial high-volume, high-impact development and systems operation. Worked with other developers to migrate legacy code base into version control (From CVS/Folders into SVN) as well as bringing Hudson (Now Jenkins) into the development pipeline.

Worked with our operations team on migration of datacenter with zero-downtime from US to new servers in the UK by implementing software load balancing and routing tools, monitoring and validation systems and installation and configuration of new services.
