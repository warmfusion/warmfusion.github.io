Hi!

I'm Toby, and I'm really glad you've found my site, I'm not the best writer in the world, and most of the time I wish I could just dictate my thoughts and let someone else do the writing, so I hope you'll forgive any typos, grammar or extraordinary abuse of the humble comma.

# Who I am

I'm a bit of a dabbler, a jack of all trades and master of *some*. I love finding out new things, learning little bits of this and that and discovering new ways of putting unexpected things together. 

I live in the beautiful city of Bath (UK) with my fiancée in a house filled with exciting half finished (projects)[/projects/], books on every subject and and a rather messy garden.

# What I do

## Outside the office

I've just started spending time with (bath hacked)[http://www.bathhacked.org/] creating and manipulating (open data)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data] for the Bath community. Checkout our work on the (bathhacked.org)[http://www.bathhacked.org/] website or in GitHub (@bathhacked)[https://github.com/bathhacked].

I'm also on Twitter... <a href="https://twitter.com/warmfusion" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false" data-dnt="true"></a>
<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script> 

I love playing with electronics (projects)[/projects/], and whilst I have a problem finishing any before I get interested in something new, I've always got something interesting on the go.

## Working Life

I'm a Software Engineer working for (PayPoint Mobile and Online)[https://www.paypoint.com/en-gb/mobile-online], where I help our teams
